== Getting started ==

=== Identifying to the bot ===

After running supybot-wizard and starting the bot, connect to the same IRC network it is on, and /query it. You can identify with the `identify <name> <password>` command. You can check the bot's idea of who you are with the `whoami` command.


== Administrative tasks ==

=== Networks ===

Related plugins: [green]#Network, Services#.

==== Adding a network ====

==== Reconnecting ====

`reconnect [network] [quit message]`.

==== Listing networks ====

`networks`

.output
----
freenode: wolfe.freenode.net and ircnet: irc.elisa.fi
----

==== Adding a server ====

==== Listing network servers ====

`config networks.<network>.servers`

.output
----
chat.freenode.net:6667
----

==== Services: NickServ ====

`services password <nick> [password]` can be used to set or remove NickServ password. `services identify` identifies the bot to NickServ with the current nick.

==== Deleting a network ====

=== Channels ===

Related plugins: [green]#Channel#.

NOTE: Commands in this section (such as adding/removing channels) work in the current network, eg. the one you are messaging the bot in. The commands also accept a `[channel]` parameter which is needed only when the command is written in private.

==== Adding a new channel ====

A new channel is added by messaging the bot in the same network with `join <channel> [key]` command.

==== Removing a channel ====

`part [channel] [reason]`

==== Modifying channel config ====

`config channel [channel] <name> <value>`

==== Setting the key ====

`channel key [channel] [key]` can be used to set or clear the channel key.

==== Setting the limit ====

`channel limit [channel] [limit]` sets or clears the channel limit.

==== Channel commands ====

TODO: kban, op, voice, alert, cycle, etc.

==== Maintaining the ban list ====

`channel ban add [channel] <nick|hostmask> [expires]`

`channel ban list [channel]`

`channel ban remove [channel] <hostmask>`

NOTE: Users matching the ban list are not automatically kicked off the channel. See the `kban` command to kick and ban a user. (TODO: check)

==== Maintaining the ignore list ====

`channel ignore add [channel] <nick|hostmask> [expires]`

`channel ignore list [channel]`

`channel ignore remove [channel] <hostmask>`

NOTE: There is also a global ignore list.

==== Forcing channel modes ====

==== Listing channel nicks ====

`channel nicks [channel]`

==== Listing channels ====

`channels`

NOTE: This only works in private, to prevent knowledge of top secret channels from falling to wrong hands.

You can list channels in another network with `config networks.<network>.channels`.

==== Other channel information ====

==== Adverts ====

==== Topic operations ====

==== Logs ====

==== Auto-ops & voices ====

Auto-opping is provided by the [green]#AutoMode# plugin.

=== Users ===

Related plugins: [green]#Users#.

TODO: general info about globality of users, how bot recognizes them etc. Also note that if users knowing each others' names is an issue, they should come up with a different alias (user changename etc).

==== Adding a new user ====

`user register <name> <password>`

==== Manipulating hostmasks ====

`user hostmask add` - add your current hostmask. Obviously this makes only sense after identify.

`user hostmask add [name] [hostmask] [password]` - add hostmask for another user. If not owner, password must be given.

`user hostmask remove <name> <hostmask> [password]`

NOTE: There is no way to add network-specific hostmasks (TODO: confirm).

==== Listing users ====

`user list [glob]` - list registered users. Note that the list of users is global across networks.

==== Deleting users ====

`user unregister <name> [password]`

==== Changing password ====

==== Renaming a user ====

`user changename <name> <new name> [password]`

==== Manipulating user capabilities ====

=== General bot maintenance ===

Related plugins: [green]#Admin, Config#.

==== Setting nickname & alternative nick ====

`admin nick <newnick>`

`config nick`

`config nick.alternates` - space-separated list of alternate nicks, %s refers to nick.

==== Setting ident ====

`config ident <newident>`

==== Setting ircname/realname ====

==== Setting command prefix / controlling when the bot replies ====

TODO: config search nick & config search prefix contain related stuff.

==== Listing and searching settings ====

`config search <word>` - list config items containing word.

`config <name>` - show config value for name.

`config <name> <value>` - set config value for name.

=== Sockpuppetry ===

==== Tell ====
==== Raw server commands ====
